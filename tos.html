			<h1>Temporary rather than permanent</h1>
			<p>Last updated: September 06, 2024
				These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Dedvc Discord bot, provided by 'zoroxded' ("the
				Creator"). By adding the DedVC Bot to your Discord
				server or using any of its features, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with
				these Terms, you may not use the Bot.</p>
			<h1>1. License to Use the Bot</h1>
			<p>The Creator grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the DedVC
				Bot solely for your personal or internal business purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>

			<p>You agree to use the DedVC Bot only in compliance with Discord's Terms of Service
				(https://discord.com/terms) and Community Guidelines (https://discord.com/guidelines). You may not use
				the Bot for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</p>
			<h2>a. Age Restriction</h2>
			<p>
				The DedVC Bot is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. By using the DedVC
				Bot, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age,
				you are not permitted to use the DedVC Bot. If we become aware that a user is under the age of 13,
				we will take steps to terminate their access to the DedVC Bot and delete any personal information
				collected from them, if applicable.</p>
			<h1>3. Premium Subscription</h1>
			<p>The DedVC Bot offers a premium subscription model ("Premium Model") that provides additional features
				and benefits. By subscribing to the Premium Model, you agree to pay the specified subscription fee on a
				recurring basis using the payment processing services provided by Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe").</p>
			<h2>a. Payment Processing</h2>
			<p>All payments for the Premium Model are processed securely through Stripe. By subscribing to the Premium
				Model, you authorize the Creator to automatically charge the applicable subscription fee to your chosen
				payment method on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription.</p>
			<h2>b. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
			<p>You may cancel your subscription to the Premium Model at any time by following the cancellation
				instructions provided by Stripe or contacting the Creator directly. No refunds will be provided for any
				unused portion of the subscription period.</p>
			<h1>4. Intellectual Property</h1>
			<p>The DedVC Bot and all content provided by the Bot are owned by the Creator or its licensors and are
				protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part
				of the Bot or its content without the Creator's prior written consent.</p>
			<h1>5. Warranty Disclaimer</h1>
			<p>1. The bot may experience downtime, errors, or technical issues beyond our control. We do not accept
				responsibility for any inconvenience, loss of data, or damages resulting from the use of this bot.</p>
			<p>2. Your use of this bot is at your own risk. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including
				but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
				non-infringement.</p>
			<p>3. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the bot service at any time without prior
				notice.</p>
			<h1>6. Limitation of Liability</h1>
			<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Creator shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
				special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred
				directly or indirectly, arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the use of the DedVC
				Bot.</p>
			<h1>7. Changes to the Terms</h1>
			<p>The Creator reserves the right to modify or revise these Terms at any time by posting the updated Terms
				on the Bot's website or sending you a notice via Discord. Your continued use of the DedVC Bot after
				the changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
